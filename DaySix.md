## Baby come back :baby:
March 21, 2017

I've been really busy with other projects, I cant believe its almost been a month :scream_cat:

Today I plan to finish up sprite movement for the pygame, and then read more of the book on pygame. I've decided, if possible, at the end of this to make a comprehensive guide overviewing everything I've learned and how to easily make a game.
